prioritize.py — the gate + rank + two-track routing for discovered gaps.

Turns diagnosed candidates into two independently-budgeted, ranked action lists
(see docs/geo/operations.md §7):

  - INTEGRITY track : structural gaps (dedup/mistyping). Batch top-N into ONE wave.
  - GROWTH track    : coverage/depth/freshness. Top items collapse into a hot THEME wave.

Ranking is DATA-DRIVEN by default — no operator scoring input required:
  score ~ trending(velocity)  +  gap_value  +  theme_fit
where `theme_fit` = membership in a hot CROSS-SOURCE theme (from Stage 5 theme heat).
The stream tells us what matters; you don't have to pre-declare it. (The old manual
"strategic anchors" presupposed the very thing discovery is meant to surface — so they
are now an OPTIONAL bias, not a required input. `relevance` is likewise optional,
defaulting to 1.0.)

Usage:
    python prioritize.py            # demo set, fully data-driven
    # or import: from prioritize import route
