# Gap discovery

Self-contained discovery engine for the Geo knowledge graph. Mines the daily content
stream a space already ingests (News stories + topic-matched podcast episodes + their
Claims), finds the five gap types, ranks them, and produces Gap finding entities for review.

**Self-configuring per space.** Identity types, on-domain podcasts, and the publish
target are AUTO-DERIVED from the target space at run time (`scripts/space_profile.py`),
so the same skill runs on AI / crypto / health / any space with no per-space tuning. The
only hand-maintained knob is the global content/taxonomy denylist in `space_profile.py`.

**Stateless by design.** Every run is independent — it must NOT read prior-run
findings or drafted waves. Assume no previous run exists. (This is how the process
is perfected: clean-room runs you can compare.)

## When to use
The operator wants to run a discovery cycle on a space (AI, crypto, health, …) and
get a ranked list of gaps worth acting on.

## Inputs
- `space_id` (required) — the Geo space to run against (e.g. AI `41e851610e13a19441c4d980f2f2ce6b`).
- `days` (default 2) — recency window for the harvest.
- `strategic_anchors` — **OPTIONAL** bias only. Default runs need none: relevance is data-driven
  (trending + theme-fit). Pass `--anchors a,b,c` to Stage-4 routing only if you want to tilt a cycle.
- `action_capacity` (default 5 per track).

## Dependencies
- `python3` (standard library only — no pip install needed).
- Read access to the Geo GraphQL endpoint (baked into the scripts; no auth).
- For Stage 6 only: the `geo-write` skill + the operator's signing key (write access).
- The `Gap finding` / `Gap type` / `Gap status` types must exist on Geo to publish.

## Configuration — auto-derived, not hand-tuned
Run `python3 scripts/space_profile.py <space_id>` to see what the run will use:
- **Identity types** = the space's own types minus a global content/taxonomy denylist minus
  orphan types. (AI → Model/Provider/Lab/Agent…; crypto → Project/Protocol/Token/Network/DEX…)
- **On-domain podcasts** = per-episode gates (precedence: deny > allow > topic-overlap): a global
  `SHOW_DENYLIST` + an optional per-space `PODCAST_ALLOWLIST`, else keep iff the episode shares
  ≥ `MIN_TOPIC_OVERLAP` **distinctive** topics with the space (`harvest.py` / `space_profile.py`).
- **Publish target** = the space's datasets space from `space_profile.DATASETS_SPACE` (add one
  line per space; reuses the shared Gap-finding ontology by ID).
New space → no config edits; only add its datasets-space mapping before Stage 6. The Knowledge
Commons space (`bd727a6ad6ec4a058f681ea9002a1fbf`) self-configures like any other; its datasets
space is TBD in `space_profile.DATASETS_SPACE` (owner to designate).

## Guardrails (non-negotiable)
- **Resolve exact-name first, then a normalized + type-scoped fuzzy fallback.** `gap_diagnostic`
  matches by `isInsensitive`, then normalizes (folds unicode dash-confusables like the U+2011 in
  `GPT‑5.5`) and runs a TYPE-SCOPED substring over identity types only (catches `Mythos` inside
  `Claude Mythos Preview`). NEVER a bare all-types substring — that buries popular entities
  (`OpenAI` = 1596 all-types hits) and produces false "missing" verdicts. A norm-equal hit = same
  entity (format variant, not a gap); a token/cross-type hit = related entity → keep the gap but
  set `Gap finding subject` and flag enrich-vs-create.
- **Existence ≠ no gap.** Run all five checks; an entity that exists can still be thin,
  stale, or duplicated.
- **Enrich, don't duplicate.** Before any "create", confirm the entity doesn't exist.
- **Relations over free text. Type discipline. Every fact cites Sources.**
- **Read-only except Stage 6.** Nothing writes to the graph before the review gate.
- **Never auto-publish.** Stage 6 is human-in-loop.

## Procedure (6 stages)

### Stage 1 — Harvest  ·  Automated
```
python3 scripts/run.py harvest --space <space_id> --days 2 --with-episodes --out harvest.json
```
(prints the auto-derived profile banner, then harvests). → `harvest.json`: recent News stories
(space-scoped) + on-domain podcast episodes, with their `claims[]` and `topics[]`.
**News is space-scoped** (only the target space's stories). **Episode relevance** is decided
per-episode with three gates (precedence: deny > allow > topic-overlap):
- `SHOW_DENYLIST` (harvest.py) — pure politics/general-news shows are dropped outright.
- `PODCAST_ALLOWLIST` (space_profile.py, per space) — known on-domain shows are always kept,
  so a single off-topic week can't drop e.g. *What Bitcoin Did*.
- otherwise: keep iff the episode shares ≥ `MIN_TOPIC_OVERLAP` (default 2) **distinctive**
  topics with the space (broad/generic topics in `BROAD_TOPICS` don't count — a shared
  "U.S. politics" is not evidence of on-domain).

### Stage 2 — Extract candidates (NER)  ·  Automated (LLM)
Read `harvest.json`. Following `references/ner_prompt.md`, extract the distinct named
entities (orgs, labs, models, products, programs, people) referenced in the claim text
and story titles. → `candidates[]` (list of names).

### Stage 3 — Diagnose  ·  Automated
Write the Stage-2 output to `candidates.json` (`[{"name","velocity"}, …]`) and run the driver —
it diagnoses every candidate with live PROGRESS (no polling a background job) and writes
`profiles.json` with the resolved IDs already filled in:
```
python3 scripts/run.py diagnose --space <space_id> --candidates candidates.json --out profiles.json
```
Identity resolution is **auto-derived per space** (no hardcoded type list). Each profile carries
`gaps[]`, `canonical_id`, and — for structural dedup — `dup_ids[]` (the exact entities to merge),
so Stage 6 writes the merge/create action without re-resolving entities. (Importable too:
`from gap_diagnostic import diagnose`.)

### Stage 4 — Score + route  ·  Automated (no input required)
```
python3 scripts/run.py route --profiles profiles.json --harvest harvest.json
```
Ranking is **data-driven** — there is NO manual `relevance` or `strategic_anchors` to enter.
Score ≈ `trending(velocity) + gap_value + theme_fit`, where the hot themes are derived from the
harvest itself (Stage-5 cross-source signal) and `theme_fit` boosts candidates that belong to a
hot theme. (Strategic anchors presupposed what discovery is meant to surface; they're now an
OPTIONAL `--anchors a,b,c` bias, not a required input.)
→ two ranked tracks: **Integrity** (structural dedup, batch into one merge wave) and
**Growth** (coverage/depth/freshness, theme-bundled). The Stage-6 review gate is where the
operator de-selects anything off-domain — no per-candidate scoring needed.

### Stage 5 — Theme heat + theme-gap diagnosis  ·  Automated
```
python3 scripts/theme_heat.py  --in harvest.json
python3 scripts/theme_gaps.py  --in harvest.json --space <space_id>
```
`theme_heat` classifies themes CROSS-SOURCE (DEEP-eligible) / podcast-only (STANDARD) /
news-only (provisional) — cross-source agreement is the sustained-heat signal that sets
depth tier. `theme_gaps` then resolves each hot theme against the target space's Topic
taxonomy (exact-name + Topic-type filtered) and emits a **theme-level gap**:
- **Coverage(theme):** no Topic exists → create it.
- **Structural(theme):** Topic exists but not in this space (e.g. only in podcasts) → attach + develop here.
- **Depth(theme):** Topic exists in-space but thin/disconnected → develop the page.

Themes are first-class discovery output, not just a heat map: each theme gap becomes a
`Gap finding` (structuring work — build/attach/develop a topic page; feeds `page-developer`).

**Bounded by upstream tags.** `theme_heat`/`theme_gaps` cluster Topics ALREADY ATTACHED to
the harvested stories, so they can only re-surface themes the taxonomy already knows. They are
blind to genuinely-new themes that recur in the claim TEXT but have no Topic yet. Stage 5c fixes that.

### Stage 5c — Emergent-theme discovery  ·  LLM + Automated (wider/periodic runs)
The model-driven complement to 5a/5b. **Run on the wider/periodic runs** (e.g. 30-day), not every
daily cycle — it costs a full read of the claim corpus.
1. **(LLM — you)** read the harvested claims and PROPOSE candidate emergent theme names — patterns
   that recur across stories but may have NO Topic yet (e.g. "physical attacks on crypto holders",
   "Bitcoin ATM regulation"). Write them to a JSON file: `[{"name":"…","synonyms":["…"]}]`.
2. **(script)** run the existence ladder + **variant reconciliation** deterministically:
```
python3 scripts/theme_emergent.py --space <space_id> --themes emergent.json
```
   Verdicts: `IN-SPACE` (already covered) · `VARIANT` (a name variant already in-space → do NOT
   create, would duplicate) · `ELSEWHERE` (exact Topic in another canonical space → bring it in) ·
   `CREATE` (genuinely emergent → file a `Coverage(theme)` finding, tagged `Theme`). The `VARIANT`
   guard is what prevents duplicate topics ("Real-world asset tokenization" vs existing
   "Real World Assets", "Restaking" vs "Liquid restaking"). Only `CREATE` (and chosen `ELSEWHERE`)
   become Gap findings.

### Stage 6 — Publish discoveries  ·  Human-in-loop (review gate)

> Publishing the Gap findings goes through the geo-write skill's publishing reference (safeguards + dry-run apply). This skill prepares them; it does not bypass the write gates.
Draft a `Gap finding` per accepted gap — entity-level AND theme-level — following
`references/drafting-conventions.md` (human-first name/description/action) and
`references/discovery-schema.md`. Always set **Publish date**; add the `Trending` gap tag
when velocity ≥ TREND_TAG_FLOOR. Operator reviews; on approval, publish via `geo-write`.
**Enrich-vs-create lives here** — a "coverage" gap that's a sub-thing of an existing entity
(a program inside a lab, a model from a lab) becomes an enrich/link action, not a new entity.

**Publish with the generalized publisher — don't hand-author the glue.** Write the accepted
findings to `drafts.json` (`{target_space, publish_date, discoverer, findings:[{name, description,
recommended_action, gap_types:[…], subject?, suggested_type?, sources:[…], topics?, tags?}]}`),
get your personal-space id from geo-write's `whoami.mjs`, then:
```
NODE_PATH=<geo-write-skill>/node_modules bun --env-file=.env.geo-write run \
  scripts/publish_gaps.mjs --findings drafts.json --author <your-personal-space> [--dry-run]
```
It works on ANY space: the target datasets space's DAO address + type are resolved at runtime
(DAO → propose+vote; personal → publishEdit), and the Gap-finding ontology IDs are shared
constants. `--dry-run` builds + prints ops without submitting; drop it to publish. Mechanics +
gotchas (FAST needs a separate YES vote; real `voteProposal` sig; `url`→`text`; dates in
`datetime`) are baked in and documented in `references/stage6-publish.md`.

**Dashboard — build once per space, then reuse.** The findings display is a Topic with live-query
tables; because they're live, every operator's findings show up automatically. Build it once:
```
bun … run scripts/build_dashboard.mjs --space <host> --datasets <datasets-space> --author <you>
```
It's **idempotent** — if a dashboard already exists it prints that URL and exits (publish into the
shared datasets space and your findings appear there); pass `--force` only to build your own.

## Output
A ranked Gap finding set (two tracks) + a theme map with depth tiers, and — on approval —
`Gap finding` entities published to the space (status `Proposed`).

## Press source-discovery (salvaged from the retired geo-press-review skill)

Discover sources for a topic + date — the read-only half of the retired press-review flow. Acting on findings routes through geo-write.

Second mode: editor gives a **topic (or URL) + a date**, and the flow returns relevant **sources**, not a full review.

> Example: editor enters "Senate runoff", target date 2026-01-15 → web-search news on that topic around that date and return ranked candidate sources (headline, outlet, date, URL), flagging which are already cited in Geo.

Steps:
1. Web-search the topic scoped to the date window.
2. Pull candidate articles (headline, outlet, date, URL).
3. Cross-check against Geo (`geo-read` or `geo-coverage.json`): is this source already cited on an existing story?
4. Return a ranked source list, newest/most-authoritative first, marking ones Geo already uses.

This is the timeline-building use case — let editors reconstruct coverage for any date, not just today.
