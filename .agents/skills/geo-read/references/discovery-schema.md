# Gap finding entity schema (Stage 6)

**Source:** validated against the live graph via the geo-ontology agent (2026-05-31). The type and

which is outside this repo and not needed to run Stage 6.)

## Enums
- **Gap type** (type) → members: Coverage · Depth · Freshness · Structural · Trending
- **Gap status** (type) → members: Proposed · Accepted · Deferred · Rejected · Ingested

## Stage-6 rules
- A "coverage" gap that is a sub-thing of an existing entity → `Recommended action` = enrich the parent, NOT a new entity.
- Structural gaps → `Recommended action` = merge/retype, listing the duplicate IDs.
- Every factual value cites a `Sources` relation. Relations over free text throughout.
