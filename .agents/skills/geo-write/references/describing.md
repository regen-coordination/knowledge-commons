# Describing entities

Produces trustworthy descriptions for Geo entities: it rewrites from a source so the wording is
**original** (copyright-safe), verifies the **facts** with research proportional to their risk,
holds the output to Geo's **description rules**, and gates every result before it reaches the
human + publish step. One job: turn `(entity, type, source material)` into a vetted description
plus the `Source` citations Geo needs.

**Scope boundary (single responsibility).** This skill does not build category hierarchies (that
is the taxonomy skill), does not decide an entity's type, and does not publish. It emits a
reviewed description + Source relations and hands the write to the geo-write skill's publishing reference behind the human gate.

## When to use
A curator has a set of entities whose descriptions are missing, thin, or lifted from a scraped
source, and wants original, accurate, rules-compliant descriptions written at scale. Also for a
single "rewrite this description so it isn't copied" request.

## Inputs
A list of rows, each: `name` (required), `type` (required — for context, not assigned here),
`source_text` and/or `source_url` (the material to describe from), optional `source_license`
(`public-domain` | `cc-by-sa` | `all-rights-reserved` | unknown). One row is the single-entity case.

> v2 (not in this version): backfilling descriptions on entities already on Geo by reading their
> current value first. For now, callers supply the source material.

## Dependencies
- Python 3 (stdlib) for `scripts/check_similarity.py` lexical gate. Optional
  `sentence-transformers` for the semantic check — the script warns and skips it if not installed.
- A web search tool for Tier-1/2 accuracy verification (e.g. WebSearch).
- `geo-write` (+ the operator's signing key) for the eventual write — invoked separately, after review.

## Guardrails (non-negotiable)
- **Never auto-publish.** Output is a proposal queued for human review; the human gate is final.
- **Facts, not expression.** Facts are free to reuse; the source's *wording/structure* is not.
  Extract facts, then write from them — never synonym-swap the source's sentences (patchwriting).
  Why: copied/lightly-edited expression stays "substantially similar" and is a copyright risk.
- **Every factual claim cites a Source (P6).** The research that verifies a claim also yields its
  citation — emit `Sources` relations, don't drop provenance.
- **Relations over free text (P3).** If the description names a real-world thing (a person, org,
  product), flag it to be linked as a relation, not buried in description prose.
- **Accuracy is tiered, not assumed.** Every claim is checked to a level proportional to its risk
  (below); anything that can't be confirmed is flagged for human review, never published as fact.
- **Flag, don't guess.** On conflicting sources or an unverifiable claim, surface it — do not
  invent a resolution.

## Procedure

### Stage 1 — Ingest + classify the source
For each row, capture the source text + URL and classify the license. If `cc-by-sa` (e.g.
Wikipedia) and the goal is license-free output, treat the source strictly as a **fact source**
(re-express independently; share-alike does not attach to facts). If `all-rights-reserved`, only
facts may be reused. See `references/copyright-and-licensing.md` when a license is unclear or the
output may reuse expression.

### Stage 2 — Extract a fact list
Pull the discrete claims as a neutral list (who / what / when / numbers / relations) — the
fact-extraction step is what breaks dependence on the source's phrasing. Note which claims are
well-sourced vs. single-sourced vs. extraordinary/unsupported (drives Stage 3 tiering).

### Stage 3 — Verify accuracy (tiered, run in parallel)
Verify claims to a depth proportional to risk; fan the research out across claims/entities in
parallel for scale. Do **not** re-research what a reputable dataset already sourced.
- **Tier 0 — trust + light check:** field already carries a reputable source → keep, capture the citation.
- **Tier 1 — one corroboration:** a single-sourced claim → one confirming search; on confirm, record the source.
- **Tier 2 — multi-source or flag:** extraordinary / unsourced / conflicting → corroborate across
  ≥2 independent sources; if it can't be confirmed, **flag it** (do not include it as fact).
The sources gathered here become the `Sources` relations for Stage 6. **Verify the framing, not just existence** — correct distorted claims (e.g. a "$1T daily" that is really $1T cumulative). **Treat dynamic metrics** (TVL, volume, price, rank/"largest", user counts) qualitatively — verify at write time, never bake a number or a rank that goes stale. Full procedure + the per-claim verification-record format: `references/accuracy-verification.md`.

### Stage 4 — Compose (source hidden, to the rules)
Write from the **fact list with the source text closed**, following `references/description-rules.md`:
one or two short sentences (~50 words), neutral tone, does not start with the entity name or
restate it, covers what it is and why it matters, no repeated property data. Restructure the
information (reorder/regroup/abstract) — do not track the source clause-by-clause.

### Stage 5 — Gate (originality + accuracy + rules)
Run the deterministic closeness check, then the judgment checks. Read lexical and semantic
together — see `references/closeness-and-accuracy-checks.md` for the metrics and thresholds.
```
python3 scripts/check_similarity.py --candidate cand.txt --source src.txt --json
```
- **Originality:** high lexical overlap (a verbatim run ≥ 7–10 words, high ROUGE-2/L, high shingled
  Jaccard) → **reject and regenerate**, regardless of meaning.
- **Drift:** low lexical overlap **and** low semantic similarity → likely hallucination → **flag**.
- **Ideal:** low lexical overlap + faithful to the fact list → pass.
- **Rules:** ≤ ~50 words, 1–2 sentences, doesn't lead with the name, neutral, what + why,
  disambiguates early when the name is ambiguous.
- **Faithfulness:** every sentence is entailed by a verified/corrected claim (no unsupported additions) — see `references/accuracy-verification.md`.
Loop Stage 4 → 5 until a row passes or is flagged for a human.

### Stage 6 — Emit for review + publish
Produce, per row: `{name, description, sources:[{url, …}], relation_candidates:[…], confidence,
flags:[…]}`. Batch runs: checkpoint progress and collect flagged rows into a review queue.
The operator reviews; on approval the descriptions + `Sources` relations are written via
`geo-write` (DAO → propose+vote; personal → publishEdit). If any source was CC BY-SA and its
expression was reused, surface the attribution / share-alike / "changes made" obligations in the review.

## At scale
Parallelize Stage 3 research across rows; cap concurrency to stay within rate limits; checkpoint
after each batch so a long run is resumable; never block the whole batch on one hard row — flag it
and move on. "100% accurate" in practice means: every claim sourced and cross-checked to its tier,
with low-confidence claims withheld and flagged — not a guarantee no error ever slips through.

## Gotchas
- **Attribution ≠ a copyright fix.** Citing a source addresses plagiarism, not copying of expression.
- **Patchwriting fails the gate.** Keeping the source's sentence skeleton and swapping words stays
  substantially similar — restructure and re-express instead.
- **Thresholds are heuristics, calibrate on your samples** — they reduce risk, they are not a legal clearance.
- **The copyright material is best-practice, not legal advice.** When unsure on licensing, flag for a human.

## Output
A vetted description per entity + its `Source` relations + relation candidates, confidence, and
any flags — queued for human review, then published via `geo-write`. Flagged rows are never
auto-published.

## Files

- `references/accuracy-verification.md` — the tiered research leg: verify claims (Tier 0/1/2), verify framing not just existence, handle dynamic metrics, the verification-record format, and the faithfulness check (read in Stage 3 + Stage 5).
- `references/copyright-and-licensing.md` — idea/expression, derivative-work risk, CC BY-SA reuse obligations (read in Stage 1 when a license is unclear or expression may be reused).
- `scripts/check_similarity.py` — the deterministic closeness gate (verbatim run, ROUGE-L/LCS, shingled Jaccard; optional SBERT cosine). Run it; `--help` documents flags.
