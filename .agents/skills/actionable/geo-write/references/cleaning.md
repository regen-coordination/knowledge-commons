# Geo Knowledge Graph — Cleaning

Editor-facing skill for cleaning Geo: finding bad data, merging duplicates, deleting orphans, moving entities, fixing types. Uses Bun + `@geoprotocol/geo-sdk` **v0.20.0+** locally on the editor's machine (older SDKs target the decommissioned pre-2026-07 infrastructure — see prerequisite 4). Every destructive op runs through a Discovery + Gates + Plan template, a dry-run, and an explicit `publish` confirmation.

This reference complements the publishing reference (`references/publishing.md`, which creates new entities) — both live in the geo-write skill and share the same local setup. Works on any host (Claude Code, other desktop agents) that can read files, run bash, and reach the network.

## Project defaults — Regen Knowledge Commons

This repo's cleanup targets the **Knowledge Commons** (`bd727a6ad6ec4a058f681ea9002a1fbf`, DAO, testnet) and its aligned spaces:

- **Commons is in the canonical set.** `COMMONS_SPACE_ID` + `COMMONS_TYPE_IDS` live in `.agents/scripts/geo/src/constants.ts`; the deterministic cascade already treats it as a canonical space.
- **DAO publish path.** Cleanup on a project space is a DAO proposal (`proposeEdit` → `voteProposal` → execute), and only if the wallet is an editor of that DAO. Personal spaces are cleaned only on the editor's explicit request.
- **Hierarchy is owner-curated — no type-structure writes.** Never emit ops that create/rename/delete a Type or rewire the meta-typed hierarchy. Cleanup fixes *instances* (duplicates, orphans, entity types), never the ontology structure.

## Prerequisites — verify before first run

1. **This repo cloned** with the Geo toolkit at `.agents/scripts/geo/`. The skill imports helpers from `.agents/scripts/geo/src/` (`mergeEntities`, `selectCanonicalTopic`, `OpsBatch`, etc.).
2. **Bun installed** (`bun --version` works).
3. **`bun install` already run** (`node_modules/` exists).
4. **Repo migrated to the 2026-07 Geo infrastructure**: `@geoprotocol/geo-sdk` pinned **≥ 0.20.0** (beta pins like `^0.20.0-beta.8` count) in `package.json`, with all endpoints derived from the SDK's network config — quick check: `grep -q 'GeoTestnetConfig' .agents/scripts/geo/src/functions.ts && echo migrated`. The old infrastructure (SDK ≤ 0.19.x, hardcoded `testnet-api.geobrowser.io` / old Conduit RPC URLs) is decommissioned: during the short post-migration grace window the old endpoints still respond — everything LOOKS fine — but edits published there are not carried over, and then the endpoints go offline for good. If the check fails, STOP — migrating `src/` and the SDK pin is repo work, never something to patch around inside a generated script.
5. **`.env` filled in**: `GEO_PRIVATE_KEY=` (or legacy `PK_SW=`) and `DEMO_SPACE_ID=` set. Never `cat .env` or grep the key's value — to verify presence use `test -f .env && grep -qE '^(GEO_PRIVATE_KEY|PK_SW)=' .env && echo ok`.
6. **Network allowlist** (if the host sandboxes outbound traffic): the hosts come from the SDK's `GeoTestnetConfig` (apiOrigin, chain.rpcUrl, sponsorship.rpcUrl) — currently `testnet-api-v2.geobrowser.io` (GraphQL; the announced `api-testnet.geobrowser.io` alias serves the same data), `rpc-geo-testnet-irdc0cgb0w.t.conduit.xyz` (RPC, chain id 55516) and `rpc.zerodev.app` (gas sponsorship, publish-time), plus the IPFS gateway. Hosts surface on first failed publish — add as they appear, and re-check the config after SDK bumps (final vanity URLs like `rpc-testnet.geobrowser.io` may land in a later release).

If any prerequisite is missing, STOP and ask the editor to fix it. Do not work around.

## HARD RULES (failure = bug)

1. Before any `Write` to `scripts/` or any `bun run`, you MUST emit the operation-specific Discovery + Gates + Plan template (below) and wait for the editor to reply `go`.
2. **Two-phase execution**:
   - After `go`: write the script with `DRY_RUN = true`, run the dry-run yourself, surface the summary to the editor.
   - Ask: *"Output looks right? Type **publish** to apply the cleanup, or **stop** to discard."*
   - On `publish`: flip `DRY_RUN = false`, run again, report the per-space proposal URLs (or tx hash for a personal space) + space verify URL.
   - On `stop`: do nothing; leave the script for review.
3. **Never auto-execute a destructive op without `publish`.** `go` only authorizes the dry-run.
4. **Logging is mandatory.** Every dry-run prints per-entity decisions: `[MERGE] X (id) ← Y (id), Z (id)` / `[DELETE] X (id, 0 backlinks)` / `[SKIP] X (id, reason)` / `[ESCALATE] X (both-scored)`. No silent ops.
5. **Always use deterministic IDs for relation entities** created during merges: `from.slice(0,16) + to.slice(0,16)`. Reruns must be idempotent.
6. **Additive-only when in doubt.** If a "fix" could be done either by adding new data or by deleting old, prefer adding. Only delete when the user explicitly authorized.
7. **Data goes in the file, not in the script.** When a cleanup runs over a large list (the `scripts/<date>-*.json` exports this skill writes, or a candidate-ID/CSV list), the script **reads and parses that file at runtime** — it must NOT have the IDs/rows transcribed into it as a `const list = [ … ]` array. Baking the list in blows the token budget and times out on big sets, and risks the model corrupting IDs as it copies. The script holds only logic + helper imports; the list stays in the file. Full pattern: the publishing reference (`references/publishing.md`) → "Bulk / dataset publishing".
8. **Voting/ranking data is untouchable.** Geo's ranking data — the **Score** value property (`85a4668a42fa4f488969c0a9de0c294b`, "net upvotes minus downvotes", system-maintained), **Ranking Vote** relations (`19a4cfff45f24150abf2af0f43eb2eec` — live name "Ranking Vote", kept as `RANK_VOTES_RELATION_TYPE_ID` in `.agents/scripts/geo/src/constants.ts`; cast by **Ranking** entities, type `5c74731dfabb4dc8b5c53346521c639a`, usually from the voter's personal space) and the vote ordinal/weighted value properties (`49ee1b8918204e75a1ae38a2dcaad4a5`, `103701ddcabe4a8e835b10345327b647`) — belongs to the voters and the system, not to the entity being cleaned. **No generated op may set, copy, unset, redirect, or delete any of it, in ANY operation.** Redirecting a Ranking Vote backlink fabricates a vote; deleting one destroys a voter's data. The `src/` helpers exclude these at op-generation time (`EXCLUDED_VALUE_PROPERTY_IDS` / `EXCLUDED_RELATION_TYPE_IDS` in `.agents/scripts/geo/src/constants.ts`); scripts that assemble ops by hand must apply the same exclusion and run a scrub pass over the final batch (see [`cleaning-reference.md`](cleaning-reference.md)). Accepted consequence: a merged-away duplicate keeps its votes and Score. An entity RECEIVING Ranking Votes is *ranked* — see "Ranked entities" below for what that means for cleanup decisions.
9. **Anchored (identity) entities are excluded from deletion by default.** A space's identity — its **`page`/home entity**, its **Avatar** (profile photo) and **Cover** images — is anchored. A space wipe or bulk delete must **skip** these unless the editor explicitly overrides (Gate — Anchored-entity, below). Resolve them with `getAnchoredEntityIds(spaceId)` from `.agents/scripts/geo/src/functions.ts` (returns `{page + avatar + cover}` entity IDs) and filter every delete/unset op against that set, logging `[SKIP] <id> (anchored)`. The dry-run summary MUST state `Anchored entities excluded: N`. Why this rule exists: a bulk personal-space delete once wiped the profile photo and space description because the script processed the page entity + identity images as ordinary rows (Aug-2026 incident).
10. **Dry-run authorizations expire.** `publish` acts on the dry-run's snapshot; if the space changed in between, the op is stale. If more than **~30 minutes** elapsed between the dry-run and `publish` (or the session was interrupted/resumed), **do NOT publish the old script** — re-run discovery + the dry-run, show the fresh counts (highlight any delta), and ask for `publish` again. A 10-hour gap between `go` and `publish` was a contributing factor in the Aug-2026 wipe.
11. **Never hand-write a raw-SDK delete loop.** All destructive ops go through the `.agents/scripts/geo/src/` helpers and `publishOps` — never a bespoke `geo.entities.delete()` / `deleteEntity` loop that bypasses the exclusions above. `publishOps` refuses any batch removing data from >50 relations/values unless `CONFIRM_DESTRUCTIVE=1` is set. For a legitimate mass delete (space wipe, big merge), set that flag **only on the confirmed `publish` run** (`CONFIRM_DESTRUCTIVE=1 bun run scripts/<file>.ts`), **after** the editor's explicit `publish` and after anchored/voting exclusions are applied — never on the dry-run, never to route around a block. See [`cleaning-reference.md`](cleaning-reference.md).
12. **System entities are invisible to cleanup.** Three classes of protocol-minted entities must never appear in a candidate list, never be counted as "junk", and never be targeted by any op:
    - **Governance proposal entities** — named `Proposal <uuid>`, one per governance proposal (current infra stamps them with a "System entity for proposal …" description). They are governance bookkeeping, not broken-publish leakage, and the protocol keeps minting them — deleting them is at best churn, at worst breaks governance views.
    - **Space bookkeeping entities** — named `Space <uuid>` (including the space's own id as an entity), carrying `Payout` / `Allocated` edges. Payout & allocation accounting.
    - **Ranking entities** — type `Ranking` (`5c74731dfabb4dc8b5c53346521c639a`); they hold users' Ranking Votes and usually live in personal spaces.
    Discovery reports them as one aggregate line (`System entities excluded: N — proposals {p}, space bookkeeping {b}, rankings {r}`), logs `[SKIP] <id> (system entity)` if one reaches an op pipeline, and moves on. Detection recipes in [`cleaning-reference.md`](cleaning-reference.md).

## Ranked entities — surface them in every discovery output

Geo's ranking feature: a user's **Ranking** entity (e.g. "Books everyone should read", type `5c74731d…`, usually in their personal space) casts **Ranking Vote** relations (`19a4cfff…`) at the entities being ranked; ranking *blocks* on pages ("Submitted to Ranking Block", `09c219c103d14d2aa5c78edbf2d0182a`) render them, and the system-maintained **Score** value aggregates votes. An entity is **ranked** when it has ≥1 inbound Ranking Vote (verified example: Animal Farm `6278a4a649eb485f86c0bb1c036b5e14`, 30 inbound Ranking Votes from 30 users' Rankings).

Ranked = a user chose to put this entity on a list. That is a community-value signal cleanup must respect:

- **Every discovery output includes ranking status** — a `Ranked` column with the inbound Ranking Vote count (`relationsConnection(filter: { toEntityId: { is: X }, typeId: { is: "19a4cfff…" } }, first: 0) { totalCount }`) and the Score value where present. Every Discovery block also prints the counters `System entities excluded: N` and `Ranked candidates flagged: M`.
- **A ranked entity is never an easy delete.** Ranking Votes do not *block* deletion the way references do, but deleting a ranked entity strands real users' votes — so any delete candidate with ≥1 Ranking Vote is escalated to editor review with its vote count shown, never batched into a "delete all" bucket.
- **Merges already respect ranking** via the Score cascade rule and HARD RULE 8 (votes never migrate; a merged-away twin keeps its votes). Surface each member's vote count in the member table so the editor sees where the community's votes sit before approving.

## The operations

Each operation has a dedicated section below with its own Discovery, Gates, and Plan template.

| Operation | Destructive? | Key gate |
|---|---|---|
| Find duplicates | No | — |
| Find entities without types | No | — |
| Find blank properties | No | — |
| Find stale relations | No | — |
| Find duplicate-type relations | No | — |
| Merge duplicates | Yes | Deterministic canonical cascade + Both-Scored escalation + untouchable spaces |
| Delete orphan | Yes | Must have 0 incoming relations (vote edges listed separately) |
| Move / copy entity | Yes | Representative-topic guard; explicit `from_space` on multi-space sources |
| Fix data type | Yes | Old value preserved as comment until publish |
| Fix duplicate-type relations | Yes | Keep exactly one edge per (entity, type) |
| Delete space data | Yes (mass) | Editor types space name to confirm |

---

## Operation: Find duplicates (read-only)

Used standalone OR as the discovery step before a merge. **Two passes** — run Pass 1 always; run Pass 2 when the type is text-heavy (News story, Article, Claim, Event) where exact-name collisions are near-impossible.

### Pass 1 — Exact-name grouping (cheap, deterministic)
Pattern B from the geo-read skill (list entities of a type): list entities of the target type (paginate every page, not just the first 50). Group by `name.toLowerCase().trim()`. Surface groups with 2+ members.

Pass 1 works well for **People / Orgs / Projects / Topics** (canonical names recur verbatim — "ethereum" published four times). It is **structurally blind to news/article near-duplicates**: two stories about the same event almost never share a byte-identical headline, so Pass 1 returns 0 groups even when genuine same-event dupes exist. Verified: exact-name grouping over 1,087 Crypto News stories → **0 groups**, while ~4 genuine same-event near-dupes were present.

**Inventory mode (optional, for big sweeps):** when the editor wants a space-wide or multi-space dedup campaign, write the Pass-1 groups to `scripts/<date>-merge-inventory.json` (HARD RULE 7 format: one row per group — name, ids, optional forced `canonical_id`, optional `preferred_name`) and keep a **deferred-twins ledger** (`scripts/<date>-deferred-twins.json`) for out-of-scope twins found along the way (wrong type, multi-space assignments pending placement, both-scored groups). Deferred ≠ ignored: the ledger is the queue for a later pass.

### Pass 2 — Semantic near-duplicate detection (LLM judgment, NOT string similarity)
Run this for text-heavy types. The goal is **same real-world event told twice**, e.g.:
- "Senate advances GENIUS Act in new cloture vote" ↔ "GENIUS Act advances toward final Senate vote"
- "Trump Media and Crypto.com formalize their partnership…" ↔ "Trump Media is partnering with Crypto.com to launch ETPs…"
- "Priority Blockspace for Humans has launched on World Chain" ↔ "World launches Priority Blockspace for Humans"

**Do NOT use token/string-similarity (Jaccard, Levenshtein, cosine-on-bag-of-words) as the decision.** It over-flags template headlines that are *different stories*:
- "X raises $Y Series Z" vs "P raises $Q Series R" — high token overlap, **different companies, NOT dupes**
- "X secures MiCA license" vs "P secures MiCA license" — same template, **different firms, NOT dupes**

Method: (1) **pre-cluster cheaply for recall** — bucket by shared salient tokens (names, tickers, bill names) or a same-week `createdAt` window; this builds candidate pairs, it is *not* the decision. (2) **LLM-adjudicate each pair** — read both names (+ `description`/source URL) and decide *same event → near-dup; same template, different actors → keep separate*, with a confidence + one-line reason. (3) **Recommendations only** — never auto-merge a Pass-2 group; the editor confirms each. Pass 2 trades determinism for recall (can miss, can over-suggest), so Pass 1 groups are safe to "merge all" but Pass 2 groups are not.

### Output template
```
## Duplicate groups — type {type name}
Total entities scanned: {N}

### Pass 1 — exact name ({G1} groups)
| Group | Members | Spaces | Backlinks (each) | Ranked votes (each) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "ethereum" | 4 | Crypto, Crypto datasets, AI, PERSONAL | 142, 8, 2, 0 | 5, 0, 0, 0 |
| ... |

### Pass 2 — semantic near-dupes ({G2} candidate groups, ADVISORY — confirm each)
| Members (headlines) | Same event? | Confidence | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Senate advances GENIUS Act in new cloture vote" / "GENIUS Act advances toward final Senate vote" | yes | high | same Senate vote, same bill |
| "Circle secures MiCA license" / "Kraken secures MiCA license" | no | high | template match, different firms — KEEP SEPARATE |

Reply with the group(s) to merge (Pass 1: or "all"; Pass 2: name them explicitly — no "all"). The canonical is picked by the deterministic cascade (see Merge).
```

No write happens here. Output is the input for the Merge operation.

---

## Operation: Merge duplicates (destructive)

The most-requested op. Losing members merge INTO the canonical (Main) and are removed — **except** copies living in untouchable spaces, which survive there (see the Untouchable-Spaces rule). The canonical is picked by a **deterministic cascade**, not by eyeball.

### Canonical selection — deterministic cascade

Selection runs during Discovery, BEFORE any script is written. Same data in, same pick out. Implemented by `.agents/scripts/geo/src/select_canonical.ts` (`fetchCandidateMeta` → `buildScoringContext` → `selectCanonicalTopic`) — generated scripts call the helper, never re-implement the rules.

**Step 0 — hard exclusions.** A candidate resident in a **personal space** or a **dataset space** (`DATASET_SPACE_IDS` in `.agents/scripts/geo/src/constants.ts`) can never be canonical — never reference a personal- or dataset-space copy, whatever its backlink count. **Root exception:** a candidate resident in Root (Geo) (`a19c345ab9866679b001d7d2138d88a1`) is ALWAYS eligible regardless of its other residencies — the Root copy IS the graph's canonical entity.

**Step 1 — Both-Scored check.** If ≥2 eligible candidates carry a Score value → do NOT merge; fire the Both-Scored gate (below).

**Step 2 — priority cascade.** First rule that separates the candidates wins:

| # | Rule | The candidate that wins… |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Canonical space | IS a canonical space's representative topic (`space(id){topicId}` resolves to it). E.g. reference Crypto `0fcd62b5798f4078b84fa535ac95fcf3` (the Crypto space's topic), not Crypto `c6d666eb7ffa40d29db1f713eb1943f3`. |
| 2 | Canonical topic | lives in Root (Geo) space |
| 3 | Properly placed | is NOT resident *only* in a catch-all space (currently: Podcasts `b5a31f8182b042437ede0f84ee02f104`). A demotion, not an exclusion — the catch-all-only copy still merges in as a secondary. |
| 4 | Featured | has a `Tags → Featured topic` relation (`b69b8b1659df4e6d99d79956a30e8932`) — these render as Featured Timelines in the News App |
| 5 | Scored | carries a Score value (the single scored candidate is strongly preferred) |
| 6 | Curated | has a `Tags → Curated topic` relation (`7f796eb5bfc5449c98649bf7d996a2ca`) |
| 7 | More backlinks | higher TRUE backlink count (`relationsConnection.totalCount`, all spaces — never a first-page count) |
| 8 | More data | more values + relations |
| 9 | Older | smaller `createdAt` |
| 10 | Lowest id | `id.localeCompare` — stable final tiebreak |

Rules 1–6 are topic-flavored: for types that carry no tags/scores/representative status they simply never fire, and the cascade falls through to 7–10 — so it is safe for **any entity type** (People, Projects, Shows, …). (Score deliberately sits below Featured, following the implemented selection rules; the guidance doc's prose reads it higher.)

**Editor override.** An explicit editor-designated Main (reply with the id, or the `canonical_id` column in an inventory file) bypasses the cascade AND the Both-Scored escalation — a human has decided. Log it as `[forced]`.

### Untouchable spaces — vacate semantics (automatic policy)

Members partition three ways; the Plan must name each member's bucket:

- **eligible** — no personal/dataset residency (or Root-resident): may be canonical; losers are fully merged + deleted.
- **vacatable** — canonical-ineligible (personal/dataset residency) but ALSO resident in managed DAO spaces: **vacated from the managed spaces only**; the copy **survives untouched in its personal/dataset spaces**, and backlinks living in surviving spaces keep pointing at the surviving copy.
- **excluded** — resident ONLY in personal/dataset spaces: left entirely untouched (not merged, not deleted — not our data). A group where every member is excluded is skipped (`no-eligible-candidate` escalation).

Two standing guards:
- **Representative-topic guard:** never vacate a space's representative topic (`space.topicId === entity`) from its own space — it is part of the space's identity. It survives there like a personal-space copy does.
- **Editor's own personal space:** the exclusions protect OTHER people's spaces. If the editor explicitly asked to clean their own personal space, personal copies there are fair game — say so in the plan.

### Cross-space semantics — merge consolidates, never relocates

For a secondary resident in a foreign (non-anchor) space, the merge is **references-only**: backlinks in that space are redirected to the canonical (they resolve cross-space by global id); the twin's space-local values and outgoing relations are dropped with the residency. **A merge never grants the canonical new residencies** — a space that loses its twin gets the topic back only via a deliberate Move (see the Move/copy operation). The Plan's END STATE must warn about every such space.

### Discovery (mandatory before Plan)

For every group the editor selected:

1. **List every member** (id, name, spaces, types).
2. **Fetch selection metadata per member** (one gql call each — query shapes in [`cleaning-reference.md`](cleaning-reference.md)): `spaceIds`, `representsSpaces` (spaces whose `topicId` is this entity), Score values, Featured/Curated tags, TRUE backlink `totalCount`, values+relations counts, `createdAt`.
3. **Resolve the scoring context once per run**: each canonical space's representative-topic id, and which candidate spaces are `PERSONAL` (`space(id){ type }`).
4. **Partition** members into eligible / vacatable / excluded; run the cascade → canonical + anchor space (a space shared by canonical and secondaries; topical canonical space preferred over Root).
5. **Count backlinks per member, paginated to completion** (cursor-paginate `first: 500` until `hasNextPage` is false; record page count). The totalCount from step 2 ranks; the pagination proves completeness for migration.
6. **Bucket the resulting ops by target space.** Each backlink op writes to the backlink's source space, not Main's space. A merge that touches Podcasts, Crypto, and a personal space becomes separate per-space transactions / governance proposals.

### Gate — Both-Scored (HARD STOP)

Fires if **two or more eligible members carry a Score value**. Scored topics are treated as canonical-grade; fusing two of them is a human call.

STOP and tell the editor:

> Group **"{name}"** has {n} scored members — not merging (needs human review, escalate to the space's lead editor):
> | Member | ID | Score | Spaces |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | … | … | +12 | Crypto, Root |
> | … | … | +3 | Podcasts |
>
> Options: **skip** (default — the group is written to the escalation report), or reply with the id to keep as Main (**forced override** — you accept merging scored topics).

Escalated groups are appended to `scripts/<date>-escalations.txt` (name, ids, scores, spaces, reason `both-scored` / `no-eligible-candidate`) so the review queue survives the session.

### Gate — Canonical-Delete (explicit authorization)

Consolidation legitimately removes DAO-resident twins — but never silently. Two layers:

1. **Plan layer:** the END STATE block (below) must name every canonical-space copy that gets removed and every space that LOSES the topic. The editor's `go` authorizes exactly that list.
2. **Helper layer:** `mergeEntities` refuses any non-PERSONAL loser unless the script passes `allowCanonicalDelete: true`. The skill sets that flag ONLY in scripts generated after a `go` on a plan whose END STATE showed the removals. Never pass it preemptively.

**Root invariant (⛔ absolute):** the Root (Geo) space must never lose a topic. If the planned END STATE removes a topic from Root, the plan is invalid — force the Root-resident twin as canonical or drop the group. Do not offer an override for this one.

### Gate — Big-Merge (HARD STOP)

Fires if **any single member has > 100 incoming backlinks** OR **the total planned ops > 200**.

Big merges have historically lost rows (AI/Tech merge incident, 2026-05-29: 216 deletes vs 107 creates because backlinks weren't paginated to completion). Even with the pagination fix in place, large merges produce huge cross-space governance proposals and are hard to roll back.

STOP and tell the editor:

> Group **"{name}"** is too big for the auto-merge helper:
> - canonical has **{N}** incoming backlinks (cap is 100)
> - duplicate(s) have **{M}** combined
> - estimated total ops: **{ops}** (cap is 200)
>
> This needs the manual merge procedure in [`big-merge.md`](big-merge.md) — the helper has historically under-migrated rows on this scale and produced large cross-space proposals. Reply **skip** to leave this group, or **force big-merge** to override (you accept the under-migration risk and will manually verify backlink counts post-merge).

### Gate — Cross-Space-Impact

Fires if the merge writes into **more than one space**.

STOP and tell the editor:

> This merge writes into **{S} spaces**:
> | Space | createRelation | updateEntity | deleteRelation | deleteEntity | Can publish? |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | Crypto | 12 | 1 | 0 | 0 | yes (editor) |
> | Podcasts | 94 | 0 | 94 | 0 | yes (editor) |
> | World affairs | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | NO — fix package |
>
> Each non-personal space becomes its own DAO governance proposal. The Podcasts proposal in particular will churn the podcast app's topic links for **{N}** episodes.
>
> Ops for spaces where this wallet lacks editor access are NOT dropped and NOT force-published: they are exported as a **fix package** (`scripts/fix-packages/<space>/<date>/ops.json` + `report.txt` listing that space's editors) for the right editor to apply.
>
> Reply **go** to proceed across all spaces, or name spaces to exclude (e.g. `exclude Podcasts` — those backlinks stay pointing at the duplicate).

### Gate — Backlink-Pagination-Confirmation

Discovery must surface, per member:

```
Backlinks paginated to completion: YES (253 rows fetched across 6 pages, totalCount 253 ✓)
```

If the paginated row count disagrees with `relationsConnection.totalCount`, or the helper returns a count without a page breakdown, the gate fires:

> Backlink pagination for **{name}** ({id}) could not be confirmed as complete. Refusing to proceed — under-migration risk. Investigate before merging.

### Gate — Selection ambiguity (residual)

The cascade is deterministic, so ties no longer stop the merge. This gate fires only when selection **cannot run**: metadata fetch failed for a member (entity not found / API errors), or the editor asked to override but named an id outside the group. Surface the metadata table and ask for an explicit Main or **skip**.

### Gate — Data-type mismatch

If members have different data-type assignments for the same property name (e.g. one stores "Birth date" as `text`, another as `date`), STOP and ask which type wins. Don't silently coerce.

### Plan template

```
## Merge plan — type {type name}
Groups: {G}   Escalated: {E} (written to scripts/<date>-escalations.txt)
Pagination: all members confirmed paginated to completion ✓
Voting data: excluded from all ops (Score / Rank Votes stay put) ✓

Per-space ops:
| Space | createRelation | updateEntity | deleteRelation | deleteEntity | Publish route |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crypto | 12 | 1 | 0 | 1 | proposal |
| Podcasts | 94 | 0 | 94 | 0 | proposal |
| World affairs | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | FIX PACKAGE (no editor access) |

Per-group decisions:
[MERGE] "ethereum"  CANONICAL: 4cd3dcb0… (Crypto, rule 1 — canonical-space topic)
        ← 8bd19463… (Crypto datasets)  EXCLUDED — dataset space, left untouched
        ← 61bc9cb3… (AI, 2 backlinks)  eligible loser → merged + deleted
        ← a54bc45b… (PERSONAL + AI)    vacatable → vacated from AI, survives in PERSONAL
[ESCALATE] "defi"   both-scored (+12 / +3) → skipped, in escalation report
[SKIP]  "ai"        Big-Merge gate (253 backlinks > 100)

END STATE (what the graph looks like after publish):
  canonical 4cd3dcb0… → [Crypto, Root] (residencies unchanged — merge never adds any)
  twin 61bc9cb3… → fully removed
  twin a54bc45b… → survives only in [PERSONAL] (+ its votes/Score stay wherever set)
  ⚠ topic LEAVES: [AI] — twin removed there, canonical not resident (returns only via a later move)
  ⛔ Root check: no topic leaves Root ✓   (if one would: DO NOT PUBLISH — force the Root twin as canonical)

Reply **go** to write + dry-run the script. (Then **publish** to actually merge.)
```

### Execution

Use `mergeEntities` from `.agents/scripts/geo/src/entity_ops.ts` (battle-tested) with the selection results — full contract + code template in [`cleaning-reference.md`](cleaning-reference.md). Non-negotiables:

- `disableAutoSelect: true` and the cascade's pick as `mainEntityId` — otherwise the helper re-picks the Main itself and the approved plan is a lie.
- `secondaries` entries carry `residentSpaceIds` + `keptSpaceIds` from selection; pass `untouchableSpaceIds` (dataset + personal spaces) so surviving copies are skipped.
- `allowCanonicalDelete: true` ONLY after `go` on a plan whose END STATE named the canonical-space removals.
- Accumulate everything into one `OpsBatch` (`opsBatch: Map<string, Op[]>`); the script publishes per space at the end only when `DRY_RUN = false`. Spaces without editor access → fix package, never a forced publish.
- **Snapshot before publish:** during the dry-run, save each secondary's pre-merge state — `bun run .agents/scripts/geo/validate_migration.ts <secondaryId> <canonicalId> --save-snapshot scripts/<date>-snap-<secondaryId>.json`.

After publish:
1. Report per-space **proposal URLs** (`publishOps` returns the proposalId for DAO spaces): `https://www.geobrowser.io/space/{spaceId}/governance?proposalId={id-without-0x}`.
2. **Validate the migration** per secondary: `bun run .agents/scripts/geo/validate_migration.ts <secondaryId> <canonicalId> --snapshot scripts/<date>-snap-<secondaryId>.json` — all three rules (values, outgoing relations, backlinks) must PASS. A FAIL is a red flag for under-migration — investigate before approving the next merge.
3. Quick sanity: canonical's new backlink total ≈ pre-merge sum (canonical + migrated duplicates').

## Operation: Move / copy entity between spaces (destructive)

Relocate (or replicate) an entity, keeping its global id. This is also the sanctioned repair when a merge's END STATE warned `topic LEAVES [space]` and the editor wants it back there.

- **move** — recreate the entity's values + outgoing relations in `to_space`, remove them from `from_space`. **References to the entity are left untouched**: because the id is unchanged, they keep resolving to it cross-space. (Deliberately diverges from Geo's UI "Move to", which deletes source-space references.)
- **copy** — like move but the source is kept, so the entity becomes multi-space (like Geo's "Copy to"). Copied relations get **fresh ids** so the two per-space copies stay independent.

Only the entity's own data moves — not the entities it points to (those relations become cross-space) nor block children (not cascaded). Voting data stays put (HARD RULE 8).

### Discovery
1. Pattern C on the entity: name, types, values, outgoing relations, `spaceIds`.
2. Resolve `from_space`: explicit if the editor gave one; inferred when the entity lives in exactly one space.
3. Check `spaces(filter: { topicId: { is: "<id>" } })` — representative-topic guard.

### Gates
- **Multi-space source:** if the entity lives in several spaces and the editor didn't name `from_space`, STOP and ask (list the residencies).
- **Representative-topic guard:** never MOVE a space's representative topic out of its own space (copy is fine). STOP: this topic is part of the space's identity.
- **Already there:** `from_space === to_space` or already resident in `to_space` (for copy) → skip, tell the editor.

### Plan template
```
## Move/copy plan
[MOVE] "Ken Burns" (000ab247…)  Podcasts → World affairs   (references untouched, resolve cross-space)
[COPY] "Nuclear weapons" (c2bc56fd…)  Podcasts → World affairs   (source kept; fresh relation ids)

Ops: create {n} (to_space) + delete {m} (from_space, move only). Voting data untouched.
Reply **go** to write + dry-run.
```

Uses `moveEntity` from `.agents/scripts/geo/src/entity_ops.ts` (`mode: 'move' | 'copy'`).

---

## Operation: Delete orphan entity (destructive)

Delete an entity that no longer belongs (typo, test entity, abandoned record). **Only safe when nothing points at it.**

### Discovery
For each candidate ID:
1. **System-entity check first** (HARD RULE 12): governance Proposal entities, Space bookkeeping entities, Ranking entities → refuse the candidate outright, log `[SKIP] <id> (system entity)`.
2. Pattern C (its types, values, outgoing relations).
3. Pattern D incoming — count backlinks. Paginate fully.
4. Split incoming edges: **references** (block deletion) vs **Ranking Vote edges** (`19a4cfff…` — do not block, are never deleted/migrated, and remain after deletion by design). **≥1 Ranking Vote ⇒ the entity is RANKED**: it drops out of any bulk/easy-delete bucket and needs an explicit per-entity editor confirmation with the vote count shown (deleting it strands the voters' votes).

### Gate — Backlink check (HARD)
If the candidate has ANY incoming non-vote relations, STOP. Do not generate a delete op. Tell the editor:

> Entity **{name}** (`{id}`) has **{N}** incoming relations (+ {V} Ranking Vote edges, non-blocking, never touched):
> | From | Type |
> |---|---|
> | ... | ... |
>
> Delete would orphan these referrers. Options:
> - **Re-point** these relations to another entity first (specify target), then delete.
> - **Merge** this entity into another (use the merge operation instead of delete).
> - **Force delete** (acknowledged: referrers will be orphaned) — type `force delete {id}` exactly to confirm.

### Gate — Ranked entity (review, not bulk)
Fires when a delete candidate has **≥1 inbound Ranking Vote** (and passed the backlink gate — votes alone don't block). STOP and tell the editor:

> Entity **{name}** (`{id}`) is **ranked** — {V} Ranking Vote(s) from users' Rankings{score, if a Score value exists}. Deleting it strands those votes. Confirm this specific delete with `delete ranked {id}`, or **skip**.

Never fold ranked candidates into a "delete all" approval.

### Plan template
```
## Delete plan
System entities excluded: {S}   Ranked candidates flagged: {M}
[DELETE] {name} ({id}) — 0 blocking backlinks, 0 ranking votes, in space {space}
[DELETE] {name} ({id}) — 0 blocking backlinks; RANKED (2 votes) — editor confirmed `delete ranked` ✓
[SKIP]   {name} ({id}) — has 4 backlinks (gate fired; see above)
[SKIP]   Proposal 00064d73-… ({id}) — system entity (HARD RULE 12)

Will produce: deleteEntity={n}, deleteRelation={m} (outgoing relations cleaned up; Score values and Ranking Vote edges excluded).

Reply **go** to write + dry-run.
```

Uses `Graph.deleteEntity({ id })`. Also emit `deleteRelation` ops for the entity's outgoing relations (use the edge `id`, not `toEntity.id`) — except vote relations (HARD RULE 8). Score values are never unset, even on deletion.

---

## Operation: Find entities without types (read-only)

Untyped entities are leakage from broken publishes. Surface them so the editor can re-type or delete.

### Discovery — there is NO server-side "untyped" filter that works. Paginate + check client-side.

Three "obvious" approaches all fail (details in [`cleaning-reference.md`](cleaning-reference.md) gotcha 8): there is **no `types` filter field** (it's `typeIds`); **`typeIds: { isNull: true }` and `entitiesConnection.totalCount` both 504-timeout**; and **`relationsByTypeIdConnection: { none }`** is fast but a **false-positive trap** (returns rows that actually have types). Don't use any of them.

**The only reliable method: paginate the space and check `typeIds.length === 0` client-side** (`8f151ba4de204e3c9cb499ddf96f48f1` is the Types property; an entity with no Types relation has an empty `typeIds`):
```graphql
{ entities(
    first: 500,
    filter: { spaceIds: { anyEqualTo: "<spaceId>" } }
  ) { id name typeIds createdAt } }
```
Page with `after`/cursor (or `offset`) until exhausted; keep only rows where `typeIds` is `[]`. This is read-only and slow on big spaces — log progress per page and write the full list to `scripts/<date>-no-type-export.json`.

Bucket the untyped rows; label each in the output:
- **System entities** (HARD RULE 12) — `Proposal <uuid>` governance entities, `Space <uuid>` bookkeeping entities (Payout/Allocated edges), Ranking entities. **EXCLUDED from the candidate list** — reported as one aggregate count only, never listed row-by-row, never offered for deletion. (Pre-0.5.0 versions of this skill called proposal entities "husks" with default action delete — that guidance is retired; they are protocol data.)
- **Relation entities** — property-bags of live relations (an edge's `entityId`). Structural, untyped by design — excluded from the candidate list.
- **Stubs / unnamed** — named-but-empty or nameless leftovers. Candidates for review/delete once live-verified (0 global backlinks, no ranking votes).
- **Real entities** that just lost their type (e.g. "Kaito AI"). Default action **assign type**.

Reference baseline (crypto-datasets space, paginate-and-check): **193 untyped / 1,827 (~11%)**, mostly system proposal entities plus a few real ones.

### Output template
```
## Entities without types — space {space name}
Scanned (paginated): {N} entities across {pages} pages
Untyped: {U} ({pct}%)  — real: {r}, stubs/unnamed: {s}
System entities excluded: {S} — proposals {p}, space bookkeeping {b}, rankings {rk}
Relation entities excluded (structural): {re}
Ranked candidates flagged: {M}
Full list: scripts/<date>-no-type-export.json

| Name | ID | Space | Class | Ranked (votes) | createdAt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kaito AI | … | crypto-datasets | real | 0 | … |
| Old draft topic | … | crypto-datasets | stub | 3 ⚠ review | … |

Decide per-entity: **assign type** (specify type id) / **delete** (use delete-orphan op) / **leave**.
(Ranked rows — votes ≥1 — always land in review, never in a bulk delete.)
```

Read-only — no script written. Hand off to merge / delete / publish as the editor decides.

---

## Operation: Find blank properties (read-only)

Find entities of type T where property P is empty. Useful for backlog work ("every Person needs a Web URL").

### Discovery
List entities of type T (paginate). For each, check `values[].property.id === P` exists with a non-empty value. Report misses.

### Output template
```
## Blank "{property name}" on type "{type name}"
Total entities of type: {N}
Entities missing the property: {M} ({pct}%)

Sample:
| Name | ID | Space |
|---|---|---|
| ... |

Full list written to scripts/<date>-blank-{prop}.json.
```

Read-only. Hand off to a bulk publish op once the editor has source URLs.

---

## Operation: Fix data type (destructive)

A property stored under the wrong SDK type (e.g. "Birth date" published as `text` when it should be `date`). Re-publish under correct type, unset the old.

**Never applies to system value properties** — Score and the vote value properties (`EXCLUDED_VALUE_PROPERTY_IDS`) are system-maintained and off-limits (HARD RULE 8).

### Discovery
1. Identify the property's correct data type (from the type's schema entry — Pattern C on a known-good instance).
2. List entities of type T where the property exists.
3. For each, capture the current (wrong-typed) value as a string, then validate it parses under the target type (e.g. `"1815-12-10"` parses as `date`; `"about 1815"` does NOT).

### Gate — Unparseable values
If any entity's current value can't be cleanly parsed under the target type, STOP and surface a list. Options:
- **Hand-correct each** before retrying.
- **Skip unparseable** and fix only the clean ones.
- **Drop unparseable** (unset, no replacement).

### Plan template
```
## Fix data type — "{property name}": text → date
Affected entities: {N}
Clean (will be re-typed): {M}
Unparseable (gate fired): {U}

Per-entity:
[FIX]  {name} ({id})  "1815-12-10" → date
[SKIP] {name} ({id})  "about 1815" (unparseable)

Reply **go** to write + dry-run.
```

Each entity gets a `Graph.updateEntity({ values: [...], unset: [...] })` op. Batch.

---

## Operation: Find stale relations (read-only)

A relation is stale if its `toEntity.id` no longer exists (target deleted). Surface for cleanup.

### Discovery
For each entity of type T (or across a space), read its relations. For each relation's `toEntity.id`, run a quick existence check (`entity(id: "<id>") { id }`). Collect nulls.

### Output template
```
## Stale relations
Scanned: {N} entities, {R} outgoing relations.
Stale: {S} (target no longer exists).

| From | Relation type | Dangling target id | Edge id |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... |

Reply **go** to write + dry-run a cleanup that deletes the stale edges.
```

Cleanup ops use `Graph.deleteRelation({ id })` with the edge id. Ranking Vote edges are exempt even if their target vanished (HARD RULE 8) — list them separately.

---

## Operation: Find / fix duplicate-type relations

An entity's type is a relation with `typeId = 8f151ba4de204e3c9cb499ddf96f48f1` (the **Types** property) pointing to a type entity. A **duplicate-type relation** is the *same type entity listed two or more times* on one entity — two edges with identical `(fromEntity, typeId=Types, toEntityId)`. The UI then shows the type chip twice. These are publish-skill leakage (a re-run that re-created the type edge instead of skipping it).

Note: `typeIds` on the entity **dedupes**, so a duplicate is invisible there — you must look at the raw type *relations* (edges), not the `typeIds` array. Two edges to the same type → one is redundant.

### Discovery (read-only)
Per space (or per entity), fetch every Types-relation edge and group by `(fromEntityId, toEntityId)`:
```graphql
{ relationsConnection(
    filter: { typeId: { is: "8f151ba4de204e3c9cb499ddf96f48f1" }, spaceId: { is: "<spaceId>" } },
    first: 500
  ) {
    edges { node { id fromEntityId toEntityId toEntity { name } spaceId } }
    pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
  } }
```
Paginate to completion. Any `(fromEntityId, toEntityId)` key with **2+ edges** is a duplicate group; all but one edge are redundant.

Distinguish from the legitimate **multi-type** case: an entity with edges to *different* type entities (e.g. Person **and** Author) is correctly multi-typed — NOT a duplicate. Only same-`toEntityId` repeats are duplicates.

### Output template
```
## Duplicate-type relations — space {space name}
Type edges scanned: {N}
Entities with a duplicated type: {E}

| Entity | ID | Type (listed ×n) | Edge ids | Keep / delete |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Søren Halberg Vesterby | 0146e0c9… | Person ×2 | aaa…(keep), bbb…(delete) | delete 1 |

Reply **go** to write + dry-run the cleanup (deletes the extra edges, keeps the earliest by createdAt).
```

### Fix (destructive — but low-risk; only removes redundant edges)
For each duplicate group: keep one edge (default: earliest `createdAt`), and `Graph.deleteRelation({ id })` every other edge, routing each delete to its edge's own `spaceId`. No `createRelation` needed — the kept edge already carries the type. Log: `[FIX-DUP-TYPE] {entity} ({id}) — Person listed ×2, deleting edge bbb… (keeping aaa…)`.

After publish, re-query the entity's Types edges and confirm exactly one remains per type.

---

## Operation: Delete space data (mass-destructive, RARE)

Used when wiping a test space. **Never used on a DAO space or someone else's space.**

### Gate — Anchored-entity (HARD, automatic)
Before planning, resolve `getAnchoredEntityIds(spaceId)` and **exclude those entities from the delete set by default** — the space's `page`/home entity + its Avatar (profile photo) + Cover images. These are the space's identity; deleting them empties it even after the rest is repopulated (Aug-2026 incident: profile photo + description lost). The generated script filters every `deleteEntity`/`deleteRelation`/`updateEntity`-unset op against the anchored set and logs `[SKIP] <id> (anchored)`. To ALSO delete the identity (true full teardown), the editor must type a second explicit override — `delete anchored too` — after seeing the anchored list; otherwise anchored entities survive.

### Gate — Explicit confirmation
The editor must type the space NAME exactly, not the ID. Skill computes the name via Pattern C on the space ID and asks:

> About to delete **every non-anchored entity** in space **"{space name}"** ({deletable count} of {entity count}; {A} anchored identity entities — page/avatar/cover — will be kept). This includes ones referenced by other spaces (their incoming relations will go stale).
>
> Type the space name **exactly** to confirm. Anything else cancels.

### Plan template
```
## Delete-space plan
Space: "{name}" ({id})
Will delete: {N} entities, {R} relations.
Anchored entities excluded: {A} (page + avatar + cover) — kept unless "delete anchored too" given.
Voting data (Score values / Rank Votes edges) in the space: left untouched.
Outgoing breakage: {X} relations from OTHER spaces will go stale (those need a follow-up "Find stale relations" pass).

Reply **go** to write + dry-run. (Then type the space name again to **publish**.)
```

Two confirmations: space-name-typed once before Plan, again before publish. The publish run sets `CONFIRM_DESTRUCTIVE=1` (this batch exceeds the >50-destructive-op circuit-breaker in `publishOps`) — **only** on the confirmed `publish`, never the dry-run (HARD RULE 11). If the `publish` arrives >30 min after the dry-run, re-run first (HARD RULE 10).

---

## Required output template — universal scaffold

Every operation emits ONE message in this shape before any Write/Bash:

````
## Operation: {Find duplicates | Merge duplicates | Delete orphan | Move/copy entity | Fix data type | ...}

## Discovery
{operation-specific block: row counts, sampled entities, selection metadata, decisions}

## Gates
- {gate name}: PASS | FIRE — {reason or list}
- {gate name}: PASS | FIRE — {reason or list}

If any gate is FIRE, STOP HERE. Run the gate dialog and wait.

## Plan (only if gates all PASS or were waived)
- Ops: {createEntity=n, createRelation=n, updateEntity=n, deleteRelation=n, deleteEntity=n}
- END STATE (merges): residencies + LEAVES warnings + Root check
- Script path: scripts/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.ts (will be written AFTER you reply `go`)
- Dry-run command: bun run scripts/<file>.ts (I run this — you will NOT)

Reply **go** to authorize.
````

After `go`, the skill writes + dry-runs, surfaces the log lines (`[MERGE]` / `[DELETE]` / `[SKIP]` / `[FIX]` / `[ESCALATE]`), then waits for `publish` or `stop`.

## Reference — read before writing any script

Deep detail lives in [`cleaning-reference.md`](cleaning-reference.md) (bundled with the skill): **script-generation rules** (file naming, `DRY_RUN` default, publish-once, which `src/` helpers to import), the **`mergeEntities` + `selectCanonicalTopic` helper contracts + code template**, the **selection-metadata queries**, the **`validate_migration.ts` workflow**, the **voting-data scrub pass**, the **critical gotchas** (backlink pagination, inline 100-node cap, edge-id ≠ entity-id, `typeIds` dedupe, no working server-side "untyped" filter, …), and **what to do when a publish fails mid-run** (sandbox network allowlist). Consult it before generating any cleanup script.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Skip Discovery, Gates, or Plan to "save time".
- Auto-publish without an explicit `publish` reply (separate from `go`).
- Pick a Main by eyeball — canonical selection is the deterministic cascade (or an explicit editor override), nothing else.
- Merge two scored entities — both-scored groups are escalated, never fused.
- Select a personal-space or dataset-space copy as canonical, or emit ops into those spaces (their copies survive; the editor's OWN personal space on explicit request is the one exception).
- Touch voting/ranking data (Score / Ranking Votes / vote values) — in any operation, ever.
- List or target **system entities** (governance Proposal entities, `Space <uuid>` bookkeeping entities, Ranking entities) as cleanup candidates — they are excluded from every candidate list (HARD RULE 12).
- Treat a **ranked** entity (≥1 inbound Ranking Vote) as bulk-deletable junk — ranked candidates always require per-entity editor review.
- Remove a topic from the Root (Geo) space via a merge. No override exists for this.
- Force-delete entities with backlinks unless the editor typed `force delete {id}` exactly.
- Touch DAO spaces unless the wallet is an editor of that DAO and the editor explicitly named the DAO space; ops for other spaces ship as fix packages, never forced.
- Reimplement merge/selection logic — use `src/` helpers (see [`cleaning-reference.md`](cleaning-reference.md)).
