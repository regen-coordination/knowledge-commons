# Geo Knowledge Graph — Orchestrator

The skill non-technical editors invoke. It routes between `geo-read` (read) and `geo-write` (write), and for non-trivial jobs it writes a runnable `.mjs` script in the user's project, dry-runs it, and shows the editor the plan before anything is published.

This is the entry point editors should use. `geo-read` and `geo-write` are the building blocks the orchestrator calls.

## When to apply

Use this skill when:

- The editor describes an outcome, not a step ("merge these duplicates", "add Web URL to every Person").
- The task involves both reading and writing (most real editor work).
- The task is bulk or repetitive — script generation is justified.
- The editor says "I want to..." or asks "can you...".

Do NOT use this skill if:

- The user is asking a pure question about Geo → call `geo-read` directly.
- The user already has the IDs and just wants to publish one entity → call `geo-write` directly.

## The orchestrator algorithm

Every job goes through these five steps. Skip them and you will publish wrong data.

**HARD RULES (failure = bug):**
1. Before any `Write` to `scripts/` or any `Bash` running `bun run`, you MUST emit the "Discovery + Gates + Plan" block (template below) as a single message AND wait for the editor to reply "go".
2. The duplicate-candidate search in Step 2 is by **name only, across all types and all spaces**. Never restrict by type — "Bitcoin" the Project is a duplicate of "Bitcoin" the Token for editor-review purposes.
3. "I have everything I need" / "Writing the script" / any equivalent short summary is NOT a substitute for the template. Emit the full template even when everything looks clean.

## Required output template (fill and post BEFORE any Write/Bash)

````
## Discovery
**Type (per the geo-ontology agent)** — <content kind → correct type> (`<typeId>`); expected properties: <list>.
**Schema**
- Type: <name> (`<id>`)
- Properties to set: <name> (`<id>`, dataType=<text|url|date|...>), ...
- Relation types: <name> (`<id>`), ...

**Duplicate candidates** — name-only search across ALL types and ALL spaces:
| Name | ID | Type | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
(or: "no candidates found")

**Current state** (for updates only): <list values[] and relations, or "n/a — create only">

**Off-schema delta**: <list properties/relations NOT on the type schema, or "none — all on schema">

## Gates
- **Gate 0 (ontology / correct-type)**: PASS | FIRE — <the type is the CORRECT one per the geo-ontology agent, and its expected properties are present>
- **Gate 1 (semantic-duplicate)**: PASS | FIRE — <reason or hits>
- **Gate 2 (schema-violation)**: PASS | FIRE — <reason or off-schema list>
- **Gate 3 (relation-target)**: PASS | FIRE — <no value targets a relation `id` instead of the relation `entityId`>
- **Gate 4 (type-required)**: PASS | FIRE — <every created entity carries ≥1 type>

If any gate is FIRE, STOP HERE. Run the gate dialog (see below) and wait for the editor.

## Plan (only if all gates PASS or were waived)
- Target space: <id> (personal | DAO)
- Ops: createEntity=<n>, createRelation=<n>, updateEntity=<n>, deleteRelation=<n>
- Script path: `scripts/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.ts` (will be written AFTER you reply "go")
- Dry-run: `bun run scripts/<file>.ts` (you run this — I will NOT)

Reply **"go"** to authorize writing the script.

### 1. Intent

Restate the editor's request in one short sentence. Ask **one** clarifying question only if the request is genuinely ambiguous about what should change. Resist asking "are you sure?" — that's step 5's job.

### 2. Discover (must produce ALL five outputs below — no exceptions)

Call `geo-read`. Discover is NOT complete until you have produced and shown the editor all five outputs:

0. **Type (per the geo-ontology agent)** — the CORRECT type + expected properties for each created entity. Delegate to the geo-ontology agent (its `agents/geo-ontology/references/ONTOLOGY.md` modelling reference) or invoke the agent when modelling is ambiguous. Getting *a* type is not enough; getting the *right* type is Gate 0.
1. **Schema** — type ID + property IDs + relation type IDs for every type involved.
2. **Duplicate-candidate list** — for every entity you plan to CREATE, run a name search **by name only, across ALL types and ALL spaces** (`geo-read` Pattern A — no `space` filter, no `type` filter). List every hit with its name, ID, **type**, and space. If zero hits, say "no candidates found". Filtering by the type you're about to create defeats the gate (e.g., searching only one type misses a same-named entity of another type, which is still a duplicate concern).
3. **Current state** — for every entity you plan to UPDATE, the existing `values[]` and relations.
4. **Off-schema delta** — for every property and relation type in your planned ops, mark whether it IS or IS NOT on the entity type's declared schema.

**Never guess IDs.** If `geo-read` can't find what you need, stop and tell the editor — don't substitute defaults.

After producing the outputs, evaluate the gates below. If any fires, STOP and run the dialog with the editor BEFORE writing any script.

**Safeguards aren't side rails — they ARE the product.** Golden rule (from the curator): *before creating or updating anything, verify the exact same thing or something semantically similar does not already exist.*

**Gate 0 — Ontology / correct-type.** Fires when the planned type is not the CORRECT one per the geo-ontology agent (the classic: a bare x.com link typed `Post` instead of `Tweet`). Defer to `geo-write`'s Gate 0 dialog — the same rule and options.

**Gate 1 — Semantic-duplicate.** Triggers if output #2 (duplicate-candidate list) is non-empty for any planned create. For Claims the rule is **exact meaning only**: rephrasings count, partial overlaps do NOT ("sky is blue" vs "sky is blue because ocean is blue" → not duplicates).

STOP and ask:
> Found an existing entity that may already mean the same thing: **{name}** (`{id}`) in space **{space}**.
> - **Use existing** → I'll skip the create and reuse this ID.
> - **Publish anyway** → confirm these are NOT duplicates and I'll proceed.

**Gate 2 — Schema-violation.** Triggers if output #4 (off-schema delta) lists any property or relation type not on the entity type's schema.

STOP and ask:
> You're about to add property **{property name}** (`{property id}`) to a **{type name}** entity. This property isn't on **{type name}**'s schema.
> Off-schema properties: {list}.
> - **Add to schema first** → I'll generate a schema-update op to extend **{type name}**.
> - **Publish anyway** → the property will land on the entity but won't render in the UI.
> - **Skip the property** → drop it from this publish.

**Gate 3 — Relation-target.** Fires when a planned value targets a relation `id` instead of the relation `entityId` (properties on a relation go on the entity id). Defer to `geo-write`'s Gate 3 — there is no "publish anyway"; writing to a relation id silently loses the data.

**Gate 4 — Type-required.** Fires when any created entity would publish without a type. Defer to `geo-write`'s Gate 4 — a typeless create is the graph's #1 quality defect; there is no "publish anyway".

### 3. Plan (MANDATORY — post this message BEFORE writing any script)

You MUST post the confirmation template (bottom of file) as a single message and wait for the editor to reply "go" or to change something. The Plan message lists, in order:

- The **target space(s)** and whether they're personal or DAO.
- The **ops the script will produce**, counted by kind (`createEntity: 0`, `createRelation: 24`, `updateEntity: 47`, `deleteRelation: 3`).
- **Gate results** (semantic-duplicate, schema-violation) — pass / waived / list of hits.
- Anything **uncertain** flagged with `?`.
- The **dry-run command** and the **publish command**, both copy-pasteable.

Do NOT proceed to Step 4 until the editor replies. "Go" authorizes ONE dry-run only.

### 4. Generate (do NOT execute)

ONLY after the editor replied "go" in Step 3: write a `.ts` script in the user's project (`scripts/<date>-<slug>.ts`) with `DRY_RUN = true` at the top.

**You do NOT run the script.** The editor runs `bun run scripts/<file>.ts` themselves. Report the file path and the dry-run command, then stop. Do not call `Bash` to execute it unless the editor explicitly asks ("run it" / "do the dry run for me").

### 5. Confirm + publish

Wait for the editor to reply "go" (or to change something). Only then flip `DRY_RUN` to `false` and re-run. After publishing, surface the transaction hash / proposal ID and the verify URL on `geobrowser.io`.

## Common editor jobs and how to decompose them

### Job — "Find duplicates of type X across all spaces and merge them"

1. **Discover** (`geo-read`): `entities(typeId: X, first: 500)` → group by lowercased name → for each group count backlinks (`geo-read` Pattern 2/3) → pick Main (most backlinks, then highest-priority space using the SPACES rank from `.agents/scripts/geo/src/constants.ts`).
2. **Plan**: "Found N dup groups across M spaces. Will merge them into Mains. Skipping K Property groups due to data-type mismatch."
3. **Generate**: script imports `mergeEntities` from `.agents/scripts/geo/src/entity_ops.js`, batches ops with `OpsBatch`, prints op counts, dry-runs.
4. **Confirm + publish**: flip `DRY_RUN`, re-run, show transaction hashes per space.

### Job — "Assign Topics to Claims" (worked example)

1. **Discover** (`geo-read`): list all Claims (`entities(typeId: Claim, first: 500)`) and all Topics (`entities(typeId: Topic, first: 500)`).
2. **Reason** (LLM): for each Claim, propose 0–N matching Topics from the list. Bucket matches by confidence (high / medium / low). Surface low-confidence to the editor for review.
3. **Plan**: "Will create N `Topics` relations from Claims to Topics. P matches are low-confidence — drop them or hand-review?"
4. **Generate**: script collects `Graph.createRelation` ops for every accepted `claim → topic` pair into one `allOps` array, publishes once.
5. **Confirm + publish.**

### Job — "Add Web URL to every Person matching {filter}"

1. **Discover** (`geo-read`): `entities(typeId: Person, filter: {…}, first: 500)` → for each, `entity(id: …)` to confirm no existing Web URL.
2. **Plan**: "Will set `ContentIds.WEB_URL_PROPERTY` on N Persons. URLs sourced from {CSV / chat list / scraped}."
3. **Generate**: if the URLs come from a CSV/JSON, the script **reads that file at runtime** (don't paste the URLs into the script). It then uses `Graph.updateEntity({ values: [{ property: WEB_URL, type: "url", value }] })` per row, all in `allOps`, single publish.
4. **Confirm + publish.**

### Job — "Publish a new podcast episode" (single-entity)

1. **Discover** (`geo-read`): Pattern C schema-discovery query for an existing `Episode` to learn property/relation IDs.
2. **Plan**: standard `geo-write` plan template (Space / Name / Type / Description).
3. Write a tiny `.ts` in `scripts/` that imports `Graph` from `@geoprotocol/geo-sdk` and `publishOps` from `../../scripts/geo/src/functions.js`. Even single-entity publishes go through this path — there's no separate CLI shortcut.

### Job — "Delete a list of orphan entities"

1. **Discover** (`geo-read`): for each candidate, `entity(id: …)` + backlinks (`geo-read` Pattern 2/3) to confirm zero backlinks.
2. **Plan**: "Will delete N entities. Orphan cleanup ON / OFF?"
3. **Generate**: script imports `deleteEntity` from `.agents/scripts/geo/src/entity_ops.js`, uses `OpsBatch`, prints, dry-runs.
4. **Confirm + publish.**

## Script generation rules

When you write a script for the editor:

- **Data goes in the file, not in the script.** When the job runs over a **dataset** (CSV/JSON of rows), the script reads and parses that file at runtime and builds ops by looping the rows — never transcribe dataset rows into the script as a `const data = [ … ]` array (token blow-up/timeouts on large sets, plus fabrication/corruption risk while copying). Canonical rule + full pattern: `geo-write` → "Bulk / dataset publishing".
- **One file, one job.** `scripts/2026-05-08-merge-bitcoin-duplicates.ts`. Date prefix so successful scripts become a pattern library.
- **Top of file: comment block** restating the editor's intent and the discovered data (entity IDs, schema, source spaces). Future-you needs this.
- **TypeScript `.ts`** so it runs with `node --env-file=.env scripts/<file>.ts` (preferred for the publish step) or `bun run scripts/<file>.ts`. The repo's `@geoprotocol/geo-sdk` (v0.20+) is installed via `bun install` in `.agents/scripts/geo/`.
- **`DRY_RUN` constant at top, default `true`.** Same convention as `.agents/scripts/geo/curator-courses/06-dry-run-publish.ts`.
- **Collect ALL ops in one array, publish ONCE.** This rule is in `geo-write`; it bites just as hard from a generated script.
- **Print before publishing.** Either `console.log(allOps.length)` plus a sample of the ops, or write to a `.txt` file via `printOps` (mirror `.agents/scripts/geo/src/functions.ts`).
- **Idempotency where it matters.** For relation entities and image attachments, use deterministic IDs (`from.slice(0,16) + to.slice(0,16)`) so reruns don't create duplicates.
- **Reuse, don't reimplement.** Import `@geoprotocol/geo-sdk` and the helpers in `.agents/scripts/geo/src/` whenever the operation already exists. Don't rewrite `mergeEntities`.

## Confirmation template

Use ONE message for the plan, in this exact shape, then wait for the editor:

> **Plan**
> 1. Read N {type} entities from {space(s)}.
> 2. Generate {M} ops: createEntity={a}, createRelation={b}, updateEntity={c}, deleteRelation={d}.
> 3. Target space: {space} ({personal | DAO}).
> 4. Script written to: `scripts/<file>.ts` (DRY_RUN = true).
>
> **Gates**
> - Ontology / correct-type (Gate 0): {pass | fired — correct type surfaced above}
> - Semantic-duplicate check (Gate 1): {pass | N hits surfaced above | waived by editor}
> - Schema-violation check (Gate 2): {pass | N off-schema properties surfaced above | waived by editor}
> - Relation-target check (Gate 3): {pass | fired — relation id vs entity id}
> - Type-required check (Gate 4): {pass | fired — typeless creates listed above}
>
> **Dry-run command:**
> ```
> node --env-file=.env scripts/<file>.ts
> ```
>
> If the dry-run prints what you expect, reply **"go"** and I'll flip DRY_RUN to false and re-run for real.

## Safety rails

- **Run all five gates before generating ops** (§2). Ontology/correct-type + semantic-duplicate + schema-violation + relation-target + type-required. No skipping; an editor "waive" is explicit, not implicit.
- **Default to dry-run.** Editors must see the op count before anything is published.
- **One confirmation per publish.** "Go" doesn't authorize future runs of the same script.
- **No silent fallbacks.** If a query fails or returns nothing, stop and tell the editor — don't substitute defaults.
- **DAO-space permissions.** If the target is a DAO space and the editor isn't an editor of it, surface the error explicitly. Don't silently downgrade.
- **Don't auto-edit shared state.** Never run a publish without explicit "go", even if a previous run on the same script succeeded.
- **Stop after the first failed transaction.** Don't keep firing `sendTransaction` calls hoping the next one will land.

## Hand-offs

- → `geo-read` for any read.
- → `geo-write` for the actual op build + transaction submission via `publishOps` from `.agents/scripts/geo/src/functions.ts`.
- ← when the editor's request is ambiguous, return to the editor with **one** clarifying question, then continue.
- → manual fallback: if the job is too risky for automation (mass deletes, cross-space merges with unclear Mains), point the editor to the matching guide in the upstream `geo-explorers/content-management` repo (editor guides are not mirrored here).

## More

- Siblings: geo-read skill (reads), geo-write skill (writes), geo-ontology agent (modelling), geo-research agent (research drafts).
- Reusable repo logic to import instead of reimplementing: `../../scripts/geo/src/entity_ops.ts` (delete/merge/changeSpace), `../../scripts/geo/src/functions.ts` (`gql`, `publishOps`, `printOps`).
- Worked dup-merge / delete walk-throughs: the editor guides in the upstream `geo-explorers/content-management` repo.
- Real generated scripts to copy as patterns: `.agents/scripts/geo/scripts/` (dated `.ts` files).
